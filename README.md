# Folder Comparison Tool

This Java program allows you to compare the names of files in multiple folders and their subfolders, providing details about files with matching names. 

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HttpAnimation/FileComparator.git
   cd FileComparator
   ```

2. **Compile the Java code:**

   ```sh
   javac FileComparator.java
   ```

3. **Create a configuration file (Folders.ini):**

   Create a text file named `Folders.ini` in the same directory with the paths of the folders you want to compare, one path per line.

   Example `Folders.ini`:
   ```
      Folder1=/path/to/first/folder
      Folder2=/path/to/second/folder
   ```

4. **Run the program:**

   ```sh
   java FileComparator
   ```
